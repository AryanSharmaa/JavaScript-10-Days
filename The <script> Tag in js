JavaScript code is inserted between opening and closing script tags in HTML.
eg:-
    <script>
    alert("Hello World");  //pops out a warning on the screen
    </script>
    
    The above example is of inline js.
    
    
    External Js
    We can use external js by creating a separate file with .js extension linking with the html file in the same directory.
    ADVANTAGES
    1. It separates the code of HTML and JavaScript.
    2. It makes understanding easier.
